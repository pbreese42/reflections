When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on code from multiple computers (like work and home).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working on a project with multiple people, then you all might have different branches
that you are working on that you don't necessarily want to have on your local repository.
