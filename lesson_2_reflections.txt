What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created to start tracking revision history, but no commits are made 
yet. This is so you can choose which files to add to Git as tracked files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows only the files you're wanting to push to the repository 
through a commit.  The working directory might contain other files which you don't want
to ever commit. (like compiled files.)

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only put the files that make sense for the logical change you're trying to make in the 
staging area, so that they're the only ones being committed.
